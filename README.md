## 🟢 Beginner Track

The **Beginner Track** introduces participants to a traditional ML workflow for classification. You’ll clean and preprocess the data, explore imbalances, train multiple baseline models, and deploy your solution with Streamlit.

📌 Get started:  
➡️ [Beginner Track Scope of Works](./beginner/README.md)  
➡️ [Beginner Report Template](./beginner/REPORT.md)  
➡️ [Submit your work](./beginner/submissions/)  

---

## 🔴 Advanced Track

The **Advanced Track** takes a modern approach, applying **deep learning methods for tabular data**. You’ll design and tune neural networks, apply model explainability tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME), and explore containerized/API-based deployment.

📌 Get started:  
➡️ [Advanced Track Scope of Works](./advanced/README.md)  
➡️ [Advanced Report Template](./advanced/REPORT.md)  
➡️ [Submit your work](./advanced/submissions/)
